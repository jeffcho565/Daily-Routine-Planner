# Daily Routine Planner

A desktop-accessible productivity application.

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **React**

---

## ✅ Goals
- Build a desktop-ready app for easy access.

---

## 📦 Packaging / Distribution
### ✅ Requirement
- Convert the React application into an **.exe** for better user experience (desktop access).

### ✅ Options to Explore
- **Electron** — Wrap React into a desktop app
- **Tauri** — Lightweight alternative, uses Rust backend
- **React + Electron Builder** — Generate installers / executables

---

## 📌 Notes
- Main priority: ensure the React app can run as a standalone executable (`.exe`).
